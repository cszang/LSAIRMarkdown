# Introduction

- Combine text and code
- Code is written is chunks, text is around chunks
- Render to various outputs: PDF, slides, HTML, Word, ...
- Use templates
- Embed interactive elements with Shiny
- Great for analyzing data
- Plots adapt with code/data changes upon rendering
- Let others try out things, e.g. change parameters and re-run
- Installation: `install.packages("rmarkdown")`

# Create a new R Markdown Document

Easiest way: `RStudio > File > New File > R Markdown`

But: you can use any other text editor. Good support is offered by Emacs, inferior support by other editors like VS Code.

# YAML Metadata Section

Metadata for the document are given inside the 

```

```

at the beginning of the document. You don't need to learn YAML (it's just key-value pairs, anyway), most stuff can be filled in automatically.


# Markdown

## We already know what this is!

Refer to Konstantin's presentation and https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for reference.

## A few examples

### Embed a picture

![R Markdown is fantastic!](img/dog.png)

### Embed LaTeX math

$\Delta\Psi_{ww} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\Delta\Psi\left(t\right) dt \approx const.$

(also appears on hover-over in the editor)

# Code Chunks

## Basic anatomy

```{r}
1 + 1
sin(pi/2)
```

```{r}
plot(ts(exp(1:10)))
```

## Inline rendering

Can be turned on/off in options.

## Naming chunks

```{r a perfectly named chunk}
cat("what a great chunk of code!\n")
```

## Chunk options

### Hiding the code

```{r code is hidden, echo=FALSE}
cat("you won't see the code behind me!\n")
```

### Hiding the output

```{r output is hidden, results='hide'}
cat("you won't see the results, only the code!\n")
```

### Hide both code and output

Don't worry if you don't see anything here, that's the intended behaviour!

```{r hide everything, include=FALSE}
cat("you won't see anything!\n")
```

### Caching results

For long-running computations, it makes perfect sense to cache the results. R Markdown has a mechanism for determining when it's time to evualate the code again (e.g., checksum of dependencies has changed), but you can also do this manually.

```{r cache stuff, cache=TRUE}
z <- numeric(1e8)
```

## Other languages

Just some examples of what is possible.

### Bash

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
printf "hello\nyellow\nmellow\nworld" | grep 'ello' | sort
```

### Python

Python needs the reticulate package, don't do this now, it takes a while!

```{python, eval=FALSE}
5 + 8
```

### C++ with Rcpp

```{Rcpp, cache=TRUE}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) {
  return x * 2;
}
```

```{r}
timesTwo(3)
```

## `source` other files

# Inline Code

```{r}
answer <- 42
```

The answer is `r answer`.

# Figure options

Set width, height, figure caption etc.

```{r figure options demo, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.cap="This figure has a a caption!"}
boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```

# Tables

`knitr::kable` is one possible way:

```{r example-table}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5,])
```

# Citations

I am citing my favourite paper here [@bastin_global_2019]. Note that the bibliography is placed at the end of the document.

# R Markdown vs. "R Notebooks"

# Sharing and Collaborating

## GitHub

### Read-only

- Share rendered files (html, pdf)
- GitHub can render `*.Rmd` files nicely (static page)

### Real collaboration

- `*.Rmd` files are plain text, so a regular GitHub-flow is possible
- standard tools for diff'ing, etc.

## Binder

Takes a few steps more than for a Jupyter Notebook, but still quite manageable. See here for details and instructions: https://kbroman.org/blog/2019/02/18/omg_binder/
